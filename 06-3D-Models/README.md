# 6 3D Models
Two ways:

• building models procedurally

• loading models produced externally

## 6.1 Obj
• v – geometric (vertex location) data

• vt – texture coordinates

• vn – vertex normal

• f – face (typically vertices in a triangle)

## 6.2 Geometry

### 6.2.1 Cube

### 6.2.2 Sphere

### 6.2.3 Torus
